# Claude K8s Troubleshooter: AI-Powered Kubernetes Diagnostics Made Simple

**üìã GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/eistin/claude-k8s-troubleshooter](https://github.com/eistin/claude-k8s-troubleshooter)

Kubernetes troubleshooting can be overwhelming, especially in production environments where every second counts. What if you could combine the power of AI with expert-level Kubernetes knowledge to diagnose issues faster and more accurately? Enter **Claude K8s Troubleshooter** - an open-source project that transforms Claude Code into a specialized Kubernetes diagnostic expert.

## The Challenge: Complex K8s Diagnostics in Production

Modern Kubernetes environments are complex ecosystems with pods, services, ingresses, persistent volumes, and network policies all interconnected. When something goes wrong, DevOps engineers often face:

- **Information overload** from multiple kubectl commands
- **Time pressure** in production incident response  
- **Knowledge gaps** across team members
- **Inconsistent diagnostic approaches**
- **Safety concerns** when running commands in live environments

## The Solution: AI-Powered Expert System

Claude K8s Troubleshooter addresses these challenges by providing:

### üîç **Structured Diagnostic Workflows**
Instead of random kubectl commands, get guided investigation phases from initial assessment to root cause analysis.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Production-Safe Operations**
Read-only commands only. No `kubectl apply`, `delete`, or `edit` operations that could impact live systems.

### ‚ö° **Quick-Access Slash Commands**
Pre-configured commands for immediate troubleshooting scenarios.

### üìã **Comprehensive Reporting**
Structured analysis with actionable recommendations and prevention strategies.

## Key Features Deep Dive

### 1. Expert Troubleshooting Workflows

The system follows a proven 4-phase diagnostic approach:

**Phase 1: Initial Triage**
```bash
/k8s-status production          # Get namespace overview
/events production              # Check recent events
```

**Phase 2: Targeted Analysis**
```bash
/pod-debug failing-pod production     # Analyze specific pod
/svc-check api-service production     # Check service issues
```

**Phase 3: Deep Investigation**
```bash
/resources production           # Check resource constraints
/network-test api-service production  # Test connectivity
```

**Phase 4: Comprehensive Analysis**
```bash
/full-diag production          # Complete diagnostic report
```

### 2. Production-Safe Design

Every command is carefully designed to be non-intrusive:

- ‚úÖ **Read-only operations** - No state changes
- ‚úÖ **Non-destructive diagnostics** - Safe for live environments  
- ‚úÖ **RBAC compliant** - Works with standard read permissions
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail friendly** - All operations are standard kubectl commands

### 3. Comprehensive Analysis Capabilities

The system can diagnose a wide range of Kubernetes issues:

#### **Pod Issues**
- Startup problems (Pending, ImagePullBackOff, CrashLoopBackOff)
- Resource constraints (Memory/CPU limits, node capacity)
- Configuration issues (ConfigMaps, Secrets, volumes)
- Security contexts and permissions

#### **Service & Networking**
- Service connectivity and label selectors
- DNS resolution and service discovery
- Network policies and traffic restrictions
- Load balancing and routing problems

#### **Resource Management**
- Resource quotas and namespace limits
- Storage issues (PVC binding, storage classes)
- Node problems (capacity, taints, scheduling)
- Performance and utilization patterns

## Real-World Example: Diagnosing CrashLoopBackOff

Let's see the system in action. When you run `/pod-debug web-app-123 production`, you get structured analysis like this:

```markdown
## ISSUE SUMMARY
Pod web-app-123 in CrashLoopBackOff state with 5 restarts in last 10 minutes

## DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS
### Pod Status  
- Exit code: 1, restart count: 5
- Last restart: 2 minutes ago
- Memory usage: 240Mi/256Mi (94% of limit)

### Service Connectivity
- Service labels match pod labels correctly
- Endpoints show pod IP in ready state

### Resource Status
- ConfigMap 'app-config' mounted successfully  
- Secret 'db-credentials' present and valid

### Events Analysis
- OOMKilled events indicate memory exhaustion
- No scheduling or image pull issues

## ROOT CAUSE
Application memory limit (256Mi) insufficient for workload requirements

## RECOMMENDED SOLUTION
### Immediate Fix
1. Increase memory limit to 512Mi
2. Add memory request of 384Mi for better scheduling

### Verification Commands
kubectl top pod web-app-123 -n production
kubectl describe pod web-app-123 -n production | grep -A5 "Limits\|Requests"

## PREVENTION  
- Implement memory usage monitoring and alerting
- Consider horizontal pod autoscaling based on memory metrics
```

## Available Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose | Usage Example |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `/k8s-status` | Namespace overview | `/k8s-status production` |
| `/pod-debug` | Deep pod analysis | `/pod-debug web-app-123 production` |
| `/svc-check` | Service connectivity | `/svc-check api-service production` |
| `/events` | Recent events analysis | `/events production` |
| `/network-test` | Network connectivity testing | `/network-test api-service production` |
| `/resources` | Resource usage analysis | `/resources production` |
| `/full-diag` | Complete diagnostic analysis | `/full-diag production` |
