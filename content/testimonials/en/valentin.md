I contacted Edwin to review an infrastructure that we had built ourselves as part of a migration from Amazon ECS to Kubernetes.

I really appreciated Edwin's service, who was able to quickly point out the things to correct/improve and understand the entire essence of our stack.

Thanks to Edwin we were able to improve the security of our infrastructure as well as industrialize certain processes and also implement GitOps!

Thank you Edwin for your work! :)
