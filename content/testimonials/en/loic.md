I had the chance to collaborate with Edwin on several Cloud & DevOps projects (GCP, Terraform, Docker, GitHub, CI/CD, PostgreSQL).

Working with Edwin was a real guarantee of project success. His technical expertise not only allowed us to move fast, but also to do so following best practices, with a strong focus on maintainability, scalability, sustainability, and cybersecurity.

He consistently provided excellent follow-up, respected deadlines and budget, shared knowledge to make the team autonomous, and always came up with creative solutions whenever challenges arose.

On top of that, he's great to work with on a human level, positive, approachable, and bringing good energy. A true partner you can trust, whom I highly recommend!
