# Project Audit & Starter Kit for L'Oréal Paris

## The Challenge

L'Oréal Paris, with over 100 employees working on various IT projects driven by business objectives, faced a significant challenge: **lack of standardization** across their numerous data and application projects.

Each team was implementing their own solutions, leading to:

- **Inconsistent architectures** across projects
- **Security vulnerabilities** in some implementations
- **Slow project initialization** due to reinventing the wheel
- **Knowledge silos** between different teams
- **Difficulty maintaining** and scaling projects
- **No standardized CI/CD practices**

The objective was clear: **create a comprehensive starter kit** that would enable rapid, secure, and standardized project deployment across the organization.

## The Mission

As part of a 2-person DevOps team, our mission was to:

1. **Conduct a comprehensive audit** of existing L'Oréal projects
2. **Identify best practices and areas for improvement**
3. **Create standardized Terraform modules**
4. **Develop boilerplate projects** for different use cases
5. **Document deployment and security guidelines**

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Project Audit

### The Challenge of Being Outsiders

Conducting an audit as external consultants presented unique challenges:
- Teams had limited bandwidth to respond to our inquiries
- Breaking into established routines required diplomatic approach
- Building trust quickly to gather sensitive architectural information
- Understanding complex business contexts behind technical decisions

### Audit Methodology

We analyzed each project across multiple dimensions:

#### **Architecture Assessment**
- Infrastructure design patterns
- Scalability considerations
- Service communication strategies
- Data flow architectures

#### **Security Evaluation**
```yaml
Security Checklist:
- IAM roles and permissions
- Secrets management practices
- Network security configurations
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Vulnerability scanning processes
```

#### **CI/CD Workflow Analysis**
- Git workflow patterns
- Code lifecycle management
- Testing strategies
- Deployment automation levels
- Rollback procedures

#### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Usage**
- Terraform adoption levels
- Module reusability patterns
- State management practices
- Infrastructure documentation quality


## Phase 2: Solution Development

### Terraform Modules Created

We developed Terraform modules covering essential infrastructure needs: networking, Kubernetes, databases, storage, monitoring, logging, security, and identity management.

### Boilerplate Projects

We created templates for different project types: frontend applications (React/Vue.js), backend APIs (Node.js/Python), data processing (Apache Beam), and infrastructure (Terraform).

## Phase 3: Implementation & Documentation


### Validation & Stakeholder Buy-in

- **Presentation to senior developers** validating our approach
- **Proof of concept** implementations with selected teams
- **Training sessions** for development teams
- **Feedback incorporation** from early adopters

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Google Cloud Platform**: Primary infrastructure platform
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code implementation
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration
- **GitLab CI**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **Python**: Automation scripts and data processing
- **React**: Frontend boilerplate development
- **Node.js**: Backend API boilerplate
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring solutions

## Results & Impact

### ✅ **Standardization Achieved**
- **15 reusable Terraform modules** covering all common infrastructure needs
- **4 production-ready boilerplates** for different project types
- **Consistent security practices** across all new projects

### ✅ **Development Velocity Improved**
- **80% faster project initialization** using starter kits
- **Elimination of common architecture mistakes**

### ✅ **Security Enhanced**
- **Standardized IAM practices** across all projects
- **Secure secrets management** implementation
- **Network security** best practices enforced


## Key Deliverables

1. **Audit Report**: Comprehensive analysis of existing projects
2. **15 Terraform Modules**: Production-ready infrastructure components
3. **4 Boilerplate Projects**: Complete project templates
4. **Security Guidelines**: Comprehensive security best practices
5. **Documentation Package**: Complete implementation guides
6. **Training Materials**: Team enablement resources
