# Kubernetes Migration at Scale

## The Challenge

Le Monde Group faced a critical infrastructure modernization challenge. Their legacy architecture, built on **Google Compute Engine instances**, was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain, scale, and secure.

### The Scale of the Challenge

- **15+ Kubernetes clusters** across multiple products
- **Multiple environments** (production, staging, development) per product
- **Legacy Compute Engine** instances running critical services
- **Zero-tolerance for downtime** due to critical business requirements
- **Complex inter-service dependencies** across different products

### Key Pain Points

- **Manual scaling** during traffic spikes (major events)
- **Limited observability** into application performance
- **Difficulty rolling back** problematic deployments
- **Resource underutilization** on Compute Engine instances

## Technical Solutions Implemented

### Kubernetes Architecture

**Modern Infrastructure Design**:
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** as the orchestration platform
- **Private cluster configuration** with secure endpoints
- **Node pools** with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Security configurations** with appropriate OAuth scopes
- **Network setup** with dedicated CIDR blocks

### Containerization & Deployment

**Optimized Docker Strategy**:
- **Multi-stage builds** for image size optimization
- **Minimal base images** (Alpine Linux)
- **Non-root users** for enhanced security
- **Environment variables** for configuration management
- **Integrated health checks** for Kubernetes readiness

**Custom Helm Charts**:
- **Reusable templates** for different application types
- **Configurable values** per environment
- **Secret management** via Kubernetes secrets
- **Ingress configuration** with automated SSL certificates
- **Auto-scaling parameters** with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

### Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy

**Blue-Green Approach**:
- **Parallel infrastructure** running new Kubernetes clusters alongside Compute Engine
- **Traffic splitting** for gradual migration using load balancer weights
- **Real-time monitoring** comparing performance between old and new infrastructure
- **Immediate rollback** capability for issue detection and resolution

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Prometheus/Grafana/Loki Stack

```yaml
# Monitoring Stack Components
Prometheus:
  - Metrics collection from all Kubernetes clusters
  - Alert rules for infrastructure and application issues

Grafana:
  - Real-time dashboards for each product
  - SLA monitoring and reporting
  - Custom dashboards for business teams

Loki:
  - Centralized log aggregation from all clusters
  - Log-based alerting for application errors
  - Integration with Grafana for log exploration
```

#### Key Monitoring Dashboards

1. **Infrastructure Overview**: Cluster health, node utilization, pod status
2. **Application Performance**: Response times, error rates, throughput
3. **Business Metrics**: Article publication rates, user engagement
4. **Cost Optimization**: Resource utilization, cluster efficiency


## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Container orchestration platform
- **Docker**: Application containerization
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package management
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Loki**: Log aggregation and analysis
- **GitLab CI**: Continuous integration and deployment
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Istio**: Service mesh for advanced traffic management

## Results & Impact

### ✅ **Infrastructure Modernization**
- **15+ clusters** successfully migrated to Kubernetes
- **Zero major incidents** during migration process
- **50+ applications** containerized and deployed

### ✅ **Operational Excellence**
- **Automated scaling** during traffic spikes (major events)
- **Consistent deployment** processes across all products
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with 99.9% uptime visibility

### ✅ **Performance Improvements**
- **40% faster deployment** times compared to Compute Engine
- **60% better resource utilization** through container orchestration
- **Reduced MTTR** from hours to minutes for common issues

### ✅ **Cost Optimization**
- **30% reduction** in infrastructure costs
- **Better resource allocation** through horizontal pod autoscaling
- **Improved capacity planning** with detailed metrics

## Technical Expertise Demonstrated

### **Complex Multi-Service Architecture**
- Comprehensive analysis and mapping of inter-service dependencies
- Sophisticated migration orchestration with dependency management
- Service mesh integration for advanced traffic control

### **Critical Deployment Mastery**
- Zero-downtime deployment strategies for mission-critical applications
- Automated failover systems with instant rollback capabilities
- Advanced monitoring and real-time alerting systems

### **Enterprise-Scale Standardization**
- Creation of unified deployment patterns
- Modular architecture with reusable components
- Centralized observability with customized dashboards

## Client Testimonial

> "Edwin is someone who works autonomously and successfully leads the projects entrusted to him. He has been a driving force on various subjects, he has grown and helped grow the team. He integrated very well into the team despite the distance due to remote work, he demonstrated great ability to communicate with his team and other teams in the group, tracking his actions and projects was straightforward. Edwin doesn't need to be pushed to finish and deliver what's expected of him, he is proactive which makes things much easier."
