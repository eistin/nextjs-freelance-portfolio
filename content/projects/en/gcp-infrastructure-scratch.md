# GCP Infrastructure from Scratch

## The Challenge

When I joined Teester (now part of the Skeepers group), a rapidly growing startup in the video advice sector, I faced a significant challenge. The existing infrastructure had been built by developers directly on the Google Cloud Console, creating several critical issues:

- **Security vulnerabilities**: Many services were publicly exposed (GKE, Cloud SQL)
- **Network architecture**: Everything deployed on the default network
- **No Infrastructure as Code**: All changes made manually through console
- **Scalability concerns**: Architecture couldn't support the startup's rapid growth
- **No automation**: Manual deployment processes prone to errors

The mission was clear: **rebuild the entire infrastructure from scratch** while maintaining business operations.

## The Solution

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Design & Planning

I started by designing a completely new, secure, and scalable architecture:

- **Custom VPC network** with proper subnet segmentation
- **Private GKE clusters** with authorized networks
- **Private Cloud SQL instances** accessible only from within the VPC
- **Bastion host** for secure access to private resources
- **Load balancer** configuration for high availability
- **Redis caching layer** for improved performance

### Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code Implementation

I developed comprehensive Terraform modules for:

- **Network Module** - VPC, subnets, firewall rules for secure network segmentation
- **GKE Module** - Private cluster configuration, node pools, security settings
- **Database Module** - Cloud SQL instances, backup configuration, security policies
- **Load Balancer Module** - SSL certificates, routing rules, health checks
- **Monitoring Module** - Cloud Monitoring, alerting policies, dashboards
- **IAM Module** - Service accounts, roles, permissions management

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Working closely with the lead developer, I implemented:

- **Dual deployment strategy**: Applications deployed to both old and new environments
- **Database synchronization**: Real-time sync between environments
- **Automated testing**: Comprehensive test suite for infrastructure changes
- **Rollback procedures**: Quick recovery mechanisms in case of issues

### Phase 4: Migration Execution

The migration was executed during a planned maintenance window:

1. **Final database synchronization**
2. **DNS switchover** to new infrastructure
3. **Traffic routing** through new load balancers
4. **Monitoring and validation** of all services
5. **Decommissioning** of old infrastructure

## Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Platform**: Primary cloud provider
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Kubernetes (GKE)**: Container orchestration
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **GitLab CI**: Continuous Integration/Deployment
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed PostgreSQL database
- **Redis**: In-memory caching
- **Cloud Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution

## Results & Impact

### ✅ **Security Enhancement**
- All services moved to private networks
- Proper IAM roles and permissions implemented
- VPC firewall rules for network segmentation
- Encrypted connections throughout the stack

### ✅ **Zero-Downtime Migration**
- Successfully migrated without service interruption
- No data loss during the transition
- Seamless user experience maintained

### ✅ **Improved Scalability**
- Auto-scaling GKE clusters
- Database performance optimization
- Load balancer configuration for high availability
- Redis caching reducing database load

### ✅ **Operational Excellence**
- Infrastructure as Code for all resources
- Automated deployment pipelines
